Build the containers with the command 'docker-compose up -d --build'

Run the command 'ln -s . html' inside the project folder to enable the nginx to show the sites pages

Remember to put the host of the Wordpress as the IP of the container
To show the container IP use the command 'docker inspect 8271e7c28ea0 | grep IP', the number is the container ID
Change the location of the nginx to 'try_files $uri $uri/ index.php;' at nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
